            General Booking and Financial Terms Traveller Cancellations, Refunds and Complaints
          </h3>
          <p>
            If, as a Customer, you cancel your requested booking by raising a ticket, or if our
            decoration Vendor declines your booking request due to non availability or any other
            unforeseen situation, which will automatically cancel any booking and customers are not
            liable to pay any charges on cancellation and since The Occasionz donâ€™t collect any
            advance charges for the bookings and hence no refund is initiated on cancellation. Also,
            the vendor retains the right to cancel the booking after accepting the booking, due to
            some unforeseen event and no compensation will be paid to customers and no penalty will
            be charged from the vendor. The customers can reach The Occasionz in case of some
            emergency for some other design set up.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case the decoration vendor reach the set up location and then the service is declined
            by the customer. In such circumstances, customer is liable to pay 50% of the total
            billing amount and if customer refused to pay the penalty than it will be considered as
            a breach of contract entered by the customer at the time of booking the design.
          </p>
          <p>
            All customer complaints about their experience on services will be passed onto the
            decoration vendor &amp; his team to resolve. The Occasionz is committed to working with
            vendors to achieve a high level of service. If the response time and/or response quality
            of the vendor however continue to fall below acceptable timing and quality despite our
            working together to rectify any issues, The Occasionz reserves the right to remove the
            operators' tour listings from The Occasionz .com Marketplace, Affiliate websites, Mobile
            Apps and remove any Applications provided by us.
